        <h2>Our History</h2>

        <p>The King's Gate United Church was founded in 1950 by Reverend John Smith. It started as a small congregation of just ten people, but has since grown to become ...</p>
<p>
The United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands (UCJCI) was formed following an historic ceremony held on the grounds of Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, on December 13, 1992. 
This ceremony marked the union of the Disciples of Christ in Jamaica and the United Church of Jamaica and the Grand Cayman Islands
</p>

<p>
The journey of this unification began as far back as the 1880s when efforts were made to bring about the union between the then United Presbyterian Church and the Congregational Churches operating in Jamaica. 
The first complete step was made on the December 1, 1965, when the Presbyterian Church in Jamaica and the Congregational Union of Jamaica became one Church, the United Church of Jamaica and The Grand Cayman Islands.
